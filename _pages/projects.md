<ul>
<li><strong> Conditional MedicalGAN for Data Augmentation</strong> - [<a href="https://github.com/sujaykumarmag/medicalGAN">Github</a>] </li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"> This project enerates images based on a provided label or condition while utilizing Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. This approach is particularly useful in addressing class imbalance issues in image datasets. My experience with this technique has been primarily in 2 datasets, namely the Pneumonia and Covid Lung CT datasets. </p>


<ul>
<li><strong>3D Object Recognition</strong> - [<a href="https://github.com/sujaykumarmag/3d-object-recognition">Github</a>] </li> 
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"> This project aimed for 3D Object Recognition using the LiDAR sensor an improvement on Complex-YOLO, a real-time 3D object detection network designed exclusively for point clouds fine-tuned by the YOLO-NAS model. </p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Providing Thermal Comfort at Home/Hospitals</strong> - [<a href="https://github.com/sujaykumarmag/PMV_PPD">Github</a>] </li> 
<!-- In collaboration with researchers from The Univ. of Edinburgh and Cornell University.-->
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">This Project assesses thermal comfort using algorithms that predict temperature, humidity, and air velocity with SVR and classify thermal sensation levels with semi-supervised algorithms. It is scalable and adaptable, providing a responsive and nuanced assessment of thermal comfort.</p>

<!-- Networking (SDN), it is also important to identify bugs by doing analysis across layers present in SDN and systematically track down their root cause. Errors that lurk during either policy translation (e.g., bugs, memory overflow, hardware failure, etc) or delivery (e.g., communication problems), may lead to the incorrect deployment of a large number of low-level rules in network devices. A single error can cause serious damage such as outage to business-critical services. Understanding which part of the layer in the stack has been affected is extremely challenging as the network operators have to examine tens of thousands of low-level rules. In this work, we design and develop dataplane primitives and applications on top of the primitives which enable detection and localization of errors causing the mismatch between expected and actual network behavior. -->
